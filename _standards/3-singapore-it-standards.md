#### Singapore Standard
A Singapore Standard (SS) is a nationally recognised document, established by broad consensus, including a two-month public review as required under the World trade Organization Technical Barriers to Trade (WTO BT) Agreement before publication by Enterprise Singapore. A SS can take the form of a code of practice, guide, specification, test method, terminology or management system. Conformance to standards is voluntary in nature except when specified by the regulatory bodies in legislation, e.g. Fire Code Act and Workplace Safety & Health Act.

Enterprise Singapore as the national standards body, is empowered by the law to establish and publish SS by the notification in the gazette.

#### Technical Reference
A Technical Reference (TR) is a pre-Singapore Standard that is developed with the aim of meeting an urgent industry need. This could be done in light of rapid technological changes or absence of a reference standard. Unlike a SS, a TR is published without the two-month public comment, as additional development time taken could affect its relevance to market need.

A TR is implemented for two years before a review is made on its suitability to become a Singapore Standard based on the feedback on the application of the TR by the industry. The review may result in the continuation of the TR for further industry trial, withdrawal of the TR if no longer required by the industry or elevated as a SS.
