A standard is of value only if it is put to use, and therefore the usersâ€™ requirements and market relevance of a standard have to be clearly understood before the start of any standard development project.  The different stages of standards development are given below:

#### New Work Item
Proposal for new work item shall be fully justified in relation to the benefits sought. Where possible, the requestor should provide the relevant inputs, documents and initial draft to facilitate the assessment and development of the new standard.

There should be sufficient wide support among the key users and stakeholders to give confidence that consensus can be reached in the development of the new standard.

####  Announcement of Work Commencement
Development of a new standard or initiation of review of an existing standard shall be publicly announced through a one-month public comment process. The announcement covers new work commencement or review initiation.

####  Development of a Draft Standard
In drafting the standard, it is essential to take into account the standards structure, templates and copyrights issues at an early stage to avoid potential delays prior to publication. The responsibility for the technical content of a draft standard remains with the Technical Committee / Working Group (TC/WG). International standards should be referred to directly, wherever possible. All information on or relating to the draft standard (before its publication), proceedings and work papers of the TC/WG shall be treated as confidential information, and the TC/WG members are not to disclose the confidential information without the permission of the TC/WG.

The draft standard shall be approved by the relevant Technical Committee (TC) (or Standards Committee in the absence of TC) prior to public comment. It shall be approved by the Standards Committee either during or after the public comment. For a Technical Reference which does not need to go through a 2-month public comment before publication, it shall be endorsed by the relevant Standards Committee.
