The mission of the Security & Privacy Standards Technical Committee (SPSTC) is to promulgate the development and adoption of information security and privacy standards in Singapore. It evaluates the relevant ISO and other international or national standards for adoption and use in Singapore, and supports the development of new standards where necessary or applicable.

With the proliferation of IT, organisations in all sectors of the economy are dependent on information systems and communications networks to share information as well as conduct businesses. Hence standardisation of IT security techniques is important to protect the integrity, confidentiality, reliability and availability of IT systems.
