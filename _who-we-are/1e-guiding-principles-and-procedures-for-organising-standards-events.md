(a) TCs may make proposals for a yearly budget for standards awareness events during the ITSC workplanning period, subject to ITSC Council’s approval. Whenever possible, TCs are encouraged to garner industry sponsorship for the events and budget proposed to ITSC shall include such considerations.

(b) As ITSC is a neutral platform to develop and promote the awareness and adoption of standards to the industry, events organised by ITSC are vendor neutral. Hence, the publicity of any company’s products or services is not allowed. Exceptions may only be made on a case-by-case basis, for example, a company sponsoring ITSC events, subject to the approval from ITSC.
