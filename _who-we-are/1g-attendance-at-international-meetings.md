(a) Prior to attending international standards meetings, the Singapore delegates should discuss with the national committee (i.e. mirror TC or WG under ITSC) on Singapore’s position. If there is more than one delegate attending the meetings, the appointed Head of Delegation will be the spokesperson during the meeting.

(b) The Head of Delegation shall present the national position at these meetings and not present their individual views or the view of their organisations. On matters which have not been previously deliberated, the Head of Delegation should try to delay a formal decision to be taken at the meeting so that the national committee can be consulted on their views. If however, a decision is required, the Head of Delegation may request for an adjournment to consult with other members of the delegation on Singapore’s position.

(c) The table below shows the criteria to participate in the international standards meeting as a Singapore delegate. The Head of Delegation is normally the Chair of the TC or his delegated TC member. He or she shall be a Singapore resident or citizen.
