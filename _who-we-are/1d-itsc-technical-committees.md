### General
1. Technical Committees (TC) are formed and dissolved by the ITSC Council.
2. An ITSC TC’s term of office shall be for a three-year term, and be in tandem with ITSC’s and the Standards Council’s terms of office.
3. The composition of the TC, Working Group(s) and any changes to it shall be subject to the approval of the ITSC Council.

### Formation of a New TC

1. A new TC is formed in order for ITSC to:

i) Develop and facilitate the use of standards in a specific infocomm technology domain. This is usually based on the industry needs or growing industry interest or relevance of the subject matter.

ii) Develop and facilitate the use of standards to support national infocomm initiatives.

2. Industry players may submit a proposal for standards work in a new infocomm technology domain which appears to require the establishment of a new TC. The procedures to form a new TC are:

i) The interested industry partner is to propose to ITSC Council on the need to form a pro-tem committee to study the industry needs for some Singapore Standards, which would require a new TC to be formed.

ii) ITSC Council shall assess and approve the formation of the pro-tem committee, and a 3-month period would be given for the pro-tem committee to do the study. The ITSC Secretariat shall then send the Letter of Appointment to the pro-tem committee Chair.

iii) At the end of the 3-month period, the pro-tem committee may propose to the ITSC Council on the need to establish a new TC. The proposal shall include the objective, standardisation scope and planned activities of the new TC, inclusive of the names of at least 5 organisations that would be members of this new TC.

iv) The ITSC Council shall evaluate the proposal for the formation of the new TC. Upon approval by the Council, ITSC Secretariat shall prepare the Letter of Appointment to the new TC Chair.

### TC Composition

a. Standardisation is a consensus process. A TC shall reach decisions by consensus. As a general principle, the composition of a TC and the representation on it shall be approved by ITSC Council. Any TC shall be capable of demonstrating, for external scrutiny, its fairness of representation.

Definition of consensus as given in ISO/IEC Guide 2:2004.

"Consensus: General agreement, characterized by the absence of sustained opposition to substantial issues by any important part of the concerned interests and by a process that involves seeking to take into account the views of all parties concerned and to reconcile any conflicting arguments.

NOTE: Consensus need not imply unanimity."

b. A TC shall comprise members who are key stakeholders with technical experience or expertise relevant to the scope of the work of the TC. ITSC TC members are appointed based on the following guidelines:

i. As representatives of local organisations, industry associations, professional bodies, academia or research institutes.

If nominated by an industry association, professional body or organisation, the nominee should preferably be from an organisation that is likely to use the standards under consideration. Multiple representation from an organisation, professional body or association is an exception to be allowed on a case-by-case basis, e.g. in cases where the representatives have expertise in different fields, which are relevant to the work of the TC, or if one of the representatives is the TC Chairman.

ii. As individuals in their own capacity

Members may also be appointed in their individual capacity for their expertise.

iii. As representatives of locally registered companies

Companies which are registered in Singapore can participate in a TC if they have the relevant expertise of the technical matters to be undertaken by the TC.

iv. As representatives of overseas professional bodies, industry associations or research institutions which are registered locally (e.g. ASHRAE Singapore Chapter, Internet Society Singapore Chapter). These organisations should have the relevant expertise and technology that is useful to ITSC’s standardisation programme. The criteria for selection of such organisations include the following:

* It should have a representation in Singapore.

* It should be widely recognised for its knowledge or expertise on the subject area covered by the standard.

* If it is a standards development organisation, its standards must be widely recognised and used globally and preferably contributes to or is recognised by the ISO/IEC JTC 1.

* Its standards or studies are referred to in SS or widely used by the local industry.

On international standards work, these overseas organisations can provide technical inputs but cannot represent Singapore’s view in overseas forums.

c. Overseas bodies not registered locally can only participate as co-opted member to contribute their expertise in the TC. Co-opted members shall have not voting rights.

d. Specialist expertise may be co-opted by a TC. The period of membership shall be for the duration of a particular project. After this period, they shall cease to be part of the TC. Co-opted members shall have no voting rights.

e. All TC members shall meet the following criteria:

i. Be willing and able to commit resources to actively participate in the TC.

ii. His/her presence will not create an imbalance of interests within the committee.

f. For efficiency, technical discussions and consensus building, the TC should keep the size of the TC to a manageable size of up to 15-20 organisational and/or individual members.

g. The TC is to appoint a TC Secretary from among its members to assist in the administrative management of the TC.


### The Responsibilities of a TC

The responsibilities of a Technical Committee (TC) are as follows:

(a) To appoint Working Groups (WGs) of technical experts from key organisations to draft, review and promote standards [International Standards (IS), Singapore Standard (SS) and Technical Reference (TR)]. In doing so TC shall take into consideration balanced representation from key organisations. TC can also appoint experts in their individual capacity into the WG.

(b) To develop and facilitate the use of standards in a specified area that is endorsed by its Standards Committee (SC) and to ensure that the standards developed by the WG are completed through consensus of the content, application and industry/market relevance and within the pre-agreed time frame.

(c) To undertake the following actions to help further standardisation within the specified area:

(i) Receive and consider requests for a standard from its parent SC which will include the SC’s evaluation and recommendations. The evaluations will be based on the information requested for in the New Work Item (NWI) form such as need, potential users and impact, stakeholder, effect on other standards and related issues such as productivity, regulation and trade.

(ii) Work with requestor to define the stakeholders for the standard and plan the resources needed to develop, review and promote the standard.

(iii) Consider adopting international standard without modifications, and where modification is necessary, provide justifications e.g. local regulatory requirements, tropical conditions, special social/religious considerations. Regional, overseas national and consortium standards may also be adopted with or without modification as the next alternative.

(iv) Endorse and submit all draft new or reviewed standards prepared by the WG to the SC for approval, within a pre-agreed time frame and project plan. As far as possible, TCs should not be involved in the drafting, review or modified adoption of standards unless approved by the SC. If the TC is involved in the drafting, review or modified adoption of standards, the TC shall ensure the accuracy, clarity, quality control and traceability of the technical content of the draft. TC may also serve as a National Mirror Committee for ISO and IEC work which includes the identical adoption of relevant international standards.

(d) To keep abreast of developments in international standardisation in their respective area of standardisation and to initiate appropriate action to safeguard and advance the interest of the local industry. Where relevant, participate in key international standardisation activities to safeguard and advance the interest of the industry in Singapore. The approval of the Standards Committee and SPRING shall be sought on its participation.

(e) To consider ad-hoc requests and inputs from users and stakeholders on the need to revise the content of the standards.

(f) Taking into consideration changes in technologies, regulations, base standards, complexities of standards, etc., to approve WG’s recommendation of the stability period of SS (stability period not more than 8 years) and TR (not more than 3 years), and monitor the progress of the review of standards. For TR, consider the usefulness of the document and future status of the TR with a view towards establishing a SS if appropriate.

(g) To assist Enterprise Singapore and ITSC Secretariat in answering enquiries on the standards under the TC’s purview.

(h) To safeguard the intellectual property rights and confidential information of Enterprise Singapore.

(i) To notify Enterprise Singapore of any relevant patent rights in the standards.

(l) To attend meetings regularly. If a Member is unable to attend a TC meeting, he may send a stand-in for the meeting, subject to the TC Chairman’s approval. The stand-in shall have no voting rights in the committee. Members appointed in their individual capacity are not allowed to appoint stand-ins for meetings. As a guideline, a Member should not be absent for three consecutive meetings without a valid reason. If a Member is unable to attend the meetings regularly the Member should propose a replacement from his organisation or step down from the TC.

(m) To vote promptly within the stipulated voting period.

(n) To work together with the requestors, key stakeholders and Enterprise Singapore / ITSC secretariat on the implementation/adoption of the standards and for promotional activities of the SC/TC work, e.g. work with the requestors of the standard, tap on network of stakeholders to incorporate standards in relevant programmes / schemes, speak at standards launches.
