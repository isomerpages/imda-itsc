### Introduction
The Information Technology Standards Committee (ITSC) was formed in 1990, under the purview of the Singapore Standards Council appointed by Enterprise Singapore. It is an industry-led effort made up of volunteer members from the industry, but supported by Enterprise Singapore and IMDA Singapore. It is a neutral and open platform for interested industry and government parties to come together to agree on technical standards.

ITSC promotes and facilitates the national infocomm standardisation programmes and Singapore's participation in international infocomm standardisation activities. ITSC fulfils its role by appointing the various technical committees and work groups to develop Singapore Standards where no international or industry standards exist and/or recommend the adoption of international standards as Singapore Standards. The participation in local and international standardisation efforts are also done through the appointed technical committees and working groups. There are at present some 300 technical experts and representatives from 180 organisations, engaging in ITSC's standardisation activities.

### Mission
