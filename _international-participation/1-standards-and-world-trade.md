The Technical Barrier to Trade (TBT) Agreement is one of the legal texts of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreement which recognizes the important contribution that international standards and conformity assessment systems can make to improving efficiency of production and facilitating international trade. The TBT Agreement says that where international standards exist or their completion is imminent, standardising bodies should use them, or the relevant parts of them, as a basis for the standards they develop. The Agreement also obliges WTO members to ensure that technical regulations, voluntary standards and conformity assessment procedures do not create unnecessary obstacles to trade.
